    "1. Install the modified i-pi (in folder ../i-pi-master-py3/) package on your personal Linux computer or goverment supercomputer (e.g., NERSC); see [here](http://ipi-code.org/resources/documentation/) for a guide. Here, the simplest installation method is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Before installation) The readers are strong suggested to install Anaconda or Miniconda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) before installing i-pi for better experience. Python 3 (up to 3.9) is needed for simulation.\n",

    "2. Ensure that a recent version of LAMMPS is also installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2.1. To ensure the functionality of the LAMMPS code, we can install from the source code. Under a linux (Ubuntu or Centos) environment, please download the source code, e.g., [the lammps-stable_3Mar2020 release at Github](https://github.com/lammps/lammps/releases/tag/stable_3Mar2020).\n",

    "  After downloading **lammps-stable_3Mar2020.tar.gz**, we unpack this tarball to a folder ~/source/,\n",

    "## First CavMD simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "After the installation of **i-pi** and **LAMMPS**, we can run CavMD simulations. In general, the [equations of motion of CavMD](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2009272117) are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M_{j}\\ddot{\\mathbf{R}}_{j} = \\mathbf{F}_{j}^{(0)} - \\sum_{k,\\lambda}\\left(\\varepsilon_{k,\\lambda} \\widetilde{q}_{k,\\lambda}+ \\frac{\\varepsilon_{k,\\lambda}^2}{m_{k,\\lambda} \\omega_{k,\\lambda}^2} d_{g,\\lambda}\\right)\\frac{\\partial d_{g, \\lambda}}{\\partial \\mathbf{R}_{j}}$$\n",
    "$$m_{k,\\lambda}\\ddot{\\widetilde{q}}_{k,\\lambda} = - m_{k,\\lambda}\\omega_{k,\\lambda}^2\\widetilde{q}_{k,\\lambda} -\\varepsilon_{k,\\lambda} d_{g,\\lambda}$$\n",
    "            \n",
    "Here, $M_{j}$ and $\\mathbf{R}_{j}$ denote the mass and position vector for the $j$-th atom, $\\mathbf{F}_{j}^{(0)}$ denotes the nuclear force without the cavity for atom $j$; $\\varepsilon_{k,\\lambda} = \\sqrt{m_{\\lambda}\\omega_{\\lambda}^2/\\Omega\\epsilon_0}$ denotes the  light-matter coupling strength between each molecule and the cavity mode. $\\widetilde{q}_{k,\\lambda}$,  $\\omega_{k,\\lambda}$, and $m_{k,\\lambda}$ denote the momentum, position operator, frequency, and auxiliary mass for each cavity photon mode with wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$ ($k = |\\mathbf{k}|$) and polarization direction defined by a unit vector $\\mathbf{\\xi}_\\lambda$ (with $\\mathbf{\\xi}_\\lambda \\cdot \\mathbf{k} = 0$). $d_{\\text{g},\\lambda}$ denotes the ground-state molecular dipole  of the whole molecular subsystem projected along the polarization direction $\\mathbf{\\xi}_\\lambda$. The cavity is assumed to placed along the $z$-direction, so the possible polarization directions of the cavity modes are $x$- and $y$-directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the equations of motion in mind, let us try to run the first CavMD simulations. In the folder of this README, please run\n",

And you can use any software you like to plot the IR spectrum from the xyz trajectory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that because only the $x$- and $y$-direction are coupled to the cavity, when calculating IR spectrum of liquid water, please only do Fourier transform for $\\left\\langle\\mu_x(0)\\mu_x(t)\\right\\rangle$ or $\\left\\langle\\mu_y(0)\\mu_y(t)\\right\\rangle$ to obtain the IR spectrum, where $\\mu_x(t)$ denotes the total dipole moment along the $x$ direction.

    "\n",
    "### Possible error message during simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "When rerunning an i-pi job, sometimes one can encounter the following error (the last line of the error message):\n",
    "\n",
    "*RuntimeError: Error opening unix socket. Check if a file /tmp/ipi_h2o-pimd.1.run_NVE.E0_4e-4 exists, and remove it if unused.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This error means that previously the same job was terminated unnaturally, or the same job is running in the same machine. When rerunning the same job, i-pi finds that a file called */tmp/ipi_h2o-pimd.1.run_NVE.E0_4e-4* exists so i-pi decides not to continue the simulation. In order to solve this issue, one can simply delete this file and rerun the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the existence of this file guarantees that the same job cannot be run at the same time, so that one avoids potential communication issues. When a job is done, this file is automatically deleted, and rerunning again won't encounter this issue."

Finally, it will return the overall forces for both nuclei and photons.\n",

Because each cavity photon has two polarization directions, please add an even number of **L** element (which represents cavity photons) at the end of **init.xyz** and also make sure the total number of atoms equals to the number of nuclei PLUS the number of the **L** element. For example, by default, CavMD will include one cavity photon with two polarization directions, so one needs to add the following\n",

    "Similar as external pulse excitation on molecules, we can also use a time-dependent external pulse to drive the cavity modes. However, unlike the molecules which have well-defined dipole moments, the \"dipole moment\" of cavity modes is not well-defined within our model. Hence, in order to drive the cavity modes with an external field, we need to first define the effective dipole moment of the cavity modes. Currently, the effective dipole moment of the cavity modes is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_c = Q_c \\tilde{q}_c$$\n",
    "\n",

    "Apart from the definition of the effective dipole moment (or the effective charge) of the cavity modes, the parameters for controlling the cw wave  is similar as above:\n",

    "\n",
    "All the controlling parameters are defined in a similar way as above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding cavity loss\n",
    "\n",
    "Under vibrational strong coupling, simplified models such as coupled oscillators usually need to introduce two phenomenological parameters: (i) the rate of molecular vibrational energy relaxation to ground state (vibrational linewidth), and (ii) the cavity loss rate, which describes the quality of the cavity (Q factor), or the probability for the confined cavity photon modes to leak their energy outside the cavity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For CavMD simulations, since a large ensemble of molecules is included and every nuclear degree of freedom is simulated, this approach explicitly simulates the behavior of vibrational energy relaxation to ground state, so it is unnecessary to introduce a phenomenological rate for the molecular part. By contrast, for cavity photons, in CavMD simulations we usually assume perfect cavity mirrors, i.e., cavity loss is zero. In other words, the whole molecular + photonic system conserves energy, so we usually perform CavMD simulations under a NVE ensemble to extract observables. Of course, before running NVE simulations, we need to perform a NVT simulation to fully equilibrate the molecular + photonic system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, users want to be capable to add cavity loss and see how the inclusion of cavity loss can modify observables. In other words, while the whole molecular + photonic system is simulated under a NVE ensemble, the cavity photons are connected to a thermal bath with a stochastic damping rate (the cavity loss). Equivalently, the whole molecular + photonic system is simulated under a NVT ensemble, but the interaction between the molecular part and the external bath is prohibited.\n",

    "This feature is now available in CavMD. To do it, we need to slightly modify the input file **input_traj*.xml** to:\n",

    "    <timestep units='femtosecond'> 0.5 </timestep>\n",

    "Here, we introduce a new thermostat \"cavloss_langevin\" in NVT simulations, which adds a Langevin thermal bath to the cavity photons only, and &lt;tau units='femtosecond'> defines the magnitude of cavity lifetime (inverse of loss) in the units of fs (which is 1000 fs in the above system).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the following thermostat \"cavloss_multilangevin\" introduces two different Langevin thermal baths to the molecular system (with a lifetime defined by **tau_m**) and cavity modes (with a lifetime defined by **tau_l**). This new feature can give the users more flexibility for controlling the lossy channels.\n",
