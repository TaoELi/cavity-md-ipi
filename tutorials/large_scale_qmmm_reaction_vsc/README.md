## Large scale QM/MM CavMD simulations under collective vibrational strong coupling

**Currently we need Q-Chem and the experience of compiling the Q-Chem source code to continue, so this tutorial is not for the general audience!**

**Please send me an email (taoli@sas.upenn.edu) if you need this tutorial, and I will send you the material on how to reproduce the following paper:**

- Li, T. E., Hammes-Schiffer, S.  QM/MM Modeling of Vibrational Polariton Induced Energy Transfer and Chemical Dynamics. [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2022, accepted](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02322). [additional code](https://github.com/TaoELi/cavmd_examples_qmmm)

**Sorry for this inconvenience!**
